    <h1 class="mb-4">About</h1>

    <div class="card mb-4">
        <div class="card-body">
            <p>
                I serve as a Technology Lead and Systems Administrator for a 300-student public charter school,
                responsible for identity management, endpoint administration, Google Workspace governance,
                security enforcement, vendor coordination, and infrastructure planning.
            </p>

            <p>
                My role extends beyond support into infrastructure ownership, including network segmentation design,
                VLAN planning, risk audits, and modernization initiatives aligned to long-term operational stability.
            </p>
        </div>

    <h3 class="mt-4">Infrastructure Engineering & Automation</h3>

    <div class="card mb-4">
        <div class="card-body">
            <p>
                I design systems with clear separation of compute, storage, networking, and identity.
                Recent work includes containerized workloads, persistent NFS-backed storage architecture,
                and a Golden Image Factory built with Packer, Cloud-Init, Ansible, and AWS AMI publishing.
            </p>

            <p>
                My engineering approach emphasizes immutable infrastructure, versioned artifacts,
                SSH hardening, scoped IAM usage, and elimination of unmanaged root access.
            </p>
        </div>

    <h3 class="mt-4">Observability & Reliability</h3>

    <div class="card mb-4">
        <div class="card-body">
            <p>
                I implement observability as part of system design, not as an afterthought.
                My monitoring stack includes Prometheus, Node Exporter, Grafana dashboards,
                and Alertmanager with structured Slack routing.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Service health validation and failure detection</li>
                <li>Metric aggregation and dashboard-driven diagnostics</li>
                <li>Automated restart workflows and operational safeguards</li>
                <li>Lifecycle cleanup and rollback discipline</li>

    <h3 class="mt-4">Professional Direction</h3>

    <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body">
            <p>
                I am advancing toward mid-level DevOps and Platform Engineering roles
                centered on Infrastructure as Code, CI/CD automation, cloud-native workloads,
                and scalable AWS architecture.
            </p>

            <p>
                Current areas of expansion include Kubernetes orchestration,
                Terraform multi-environment design, and production-grade pipeline validation.
            </p>

            <p>
                I approach infrastructure as an engineered system built with secure defaults,
                automation-first thinking, and operational clarity.
