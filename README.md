# Devops Cloud Portfolio
DevOps and cloud engineering portfolio featuring AWS, Terraform, Docker, observability, and immutable infrastructure projects.

# DevOps & Cloud Engineering Portfolio

This repository documents my progression from Systems Administration into DevOps and Cloud Engineering through hands-on infrastructure projects across AWS, containerization, Infrastructure as Code, and observability.

The work in this repository reflects practical system design, security-conscious configuration, and lifecycle discipline.

---

## Engineering Scope

This portfolio includes work across:

- Linux systems administration
- Networking fundamentals (DNS, DHCP, VLAN concepts)
- Docker container lifecycle and multi-service deployments
- Observability stacks (Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager)
- Immutable image pipelines (Packer, Cloud-Init, Ansible)
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- AWS core services (IAM, EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, VPC)
- Cost governance and teardown discipline

---

## Highlighted Projects

### Golden Image Factory (Immutable Infrastructure)

Automated Ubuntu AMI builds using:

- Packer
- Cloud-Init
- Ansible
- AWS AMI publishing
- Scoped IAM credentials

Focus:
- Immutable infrastructure principles
- Versioned artifacts
- Hardened SSH configuration
- Repeatable image creation workflows

---

### Containerized Observability Stack

Multi-service monitoring deployment using:

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Prometheus
- Node Exporter
- Grafana
- Alertmanager

Focus:
- Metrics aggregation
- Dashboard-driven diagnostics
- Slack-based alert routing
- Service health validation

---

### Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

Provisioned AWS resources using Terraform with:

- Variable-driven configuration
- Output management
- State file awareness
- Modular design exploration

Focus:
- Declarative infrastructure
- Reproducible environments
- Environment separation concepts

---

### Serverless Application (AWS Lambda)

Built a serverless endpoint capable of serving:

- HTML responses
- JSON API responses
- Health check endpoints

Integrated structured logging through CloudWatch.

Focus:
- Lightweight API design
- Execution roles
- Content-type routing
- Observability integration

---

### Secure Database Deployment (Amazon RDS)

Provisioned and secured a PostgreSQL RDS instance with:

- VPC security group configuration
- Controlled public access
- SSL-enforced connections
- Full lifecycle teardown discipline

Focus:
- Cloud networking fundamentals
- Least privilege configuration
- Cost-aware infrastructure management

---

## Static Portfolio Deployment

The portfolio site located in `/portfolio-site` is deployed using:

- Amazon S3 Static Website Hosting
- Object-level permissions
- Bucket policy configuration
- Public access control management

---

## Repository Structure

```
portfolio-site/   → Static AWS-hosted portfolio site
docs/             → Architecture documentation and project summaries
```

---

## Professional Direction

Advancing toward mid-level DevOps and Platform Engineering roles focused on:

- Infrastructure as Code
- CI/CD automation
- Container orchestration
- Cloud-native architecture
- Observability and reliability engineering
